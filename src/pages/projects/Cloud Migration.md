Migrating all physical computers and infrastructure to cloud-based virtual machines and services on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), aiming to enhance scalability, accessibility, and security while optimizing operational costs.

**Key Components:**

**IaC:** Leverage Terraform to automate cloud resource provisioning, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments across environments.

**Configuration Management:** Implement Puppeteer for streamlined configuration management, automating application setups and accelerating web application deployment.

**Enhanced Security Protocols:** Integrate advanced web security mechanisms, including Identity and Access Management (IAM), to protect data and ensure compliance with industry standards during migration.

**Data Migration and Optimization:** Strategically transition existing data and applications to GCP, utilizing services like Google Cloud Storage and BigQuery for optimized data management and analytics.

**Training and Support:** Provide comprehensive training sessions and ongoing support to staff, ensuring a smooth transition and equipping them with essential skills to effectively manage the new cloud infrastructure.

This project promises to transform operational capabilities, driving efficiency and security through innovative cloud solutions!
